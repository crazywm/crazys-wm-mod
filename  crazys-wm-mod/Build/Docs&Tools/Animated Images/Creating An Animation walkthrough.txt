NOTE: This walkthrough assumes you already know how to add images to the game, as it only illistrates the extra steps
	Also the example files are called Sex18.ani (which is actually a txt file) and Sex18.jpg

1. First find a gif file you want to animate
2. Use the program Avi4BMP to save the file as a sprite sheet (.jpg) format
3. create a .txt file like the example in this folder the numbers are:
		(Number of frames) (animation speed) (width of frames) (height of frames)
4. Rename the .txt file to a .ani file.
5. Other then the extension (.ani) it should be the same filename as the image
6. Place the .ani file in the desired girls directory as usual
7. Place the .jpg file in a subfolder of the girls folder called ani
8. The same naming scheme for image files still applies (preg, les, etc)
9. Enjoy :D
