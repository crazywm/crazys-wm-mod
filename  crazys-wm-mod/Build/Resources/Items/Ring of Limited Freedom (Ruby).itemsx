<Item Name="Ring of Limited Freedom (Ruby)"    
      Desc="These rings are designed to allow a slave to temporarily live as a free person, albeit with strong limitations. While worn, it neutralizes any slave branding or marks, but also imposes effects to ensure a former slave remains subservient to their master. This variation gives the wearer greater sexual desire, especially towards men, but also makes it extremely difficult to achieve release or orgasm.
