<Item Name="Tiger Shark Tooth"
      Desc="This &quot;tooth&quot; isn't a tooth at all, it is actually a tablet that gives the consumer all of the perks of a tiger shark from the famous land of Mareth. There is also a note....(tigersharks are very primal indeed, when they want sex, they will get it and satisfy both genders with their body parts. Only a few tigersharks have been seen and even so they are just as wild as their regular shark counterparts. WARNING: If eaten outside of Mareth, the power of this tablet increases tenfold.) (+lots stat/skills, +lots traits, +slow learner)"
