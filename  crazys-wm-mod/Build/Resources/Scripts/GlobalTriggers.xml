<!--
 ! The parameters a trigger accepts depend on the Type attribute. 
 ! These are the recognised values for Type
 !
 !	"Random"	May trigger each week
 !	"Shopping"	May trigger when shopping
 !	"Skill"		May trigger when a skill is greater or equal to a value
 !	"Stat"          May trigger when a stat is greater or equal to a value
 !	"Status"	has a particular status, ie slave, pregnant etc

 !	"GlobalFlag"    Triggered when a global flag is set
 !	"ScriptRun"     Triggered when a specifed script has been run
 !	"Kidnapped"     Triggers when a girl is kidnapped
 !
 ! If the trigger type is "Skill" or "Stat", it needs a
 ! "Skill" or "Stat" attribute to specify which skill/stat to
 ! watch. Possible values for Stat:
 !
 !	"Charisma" 		"Happiness"
 !	"Libido"		"Beauty"
 !	"Constitution"		"Intelligence"
 !	"Confidence" 		"Mana"
 !	"Agility"		"Fame"
 !	"Level"			"AskPrice"
 !	"House"			"Exp"
 !	"Age"			"Obedience"
 !	"Spirit"		"Health"
 !	"Tiredness"		"PCFear" 
 !	"PCLove"		"PCHate"
 !
 ! Values for Skill
 !	"Anal"		"Magic"		"BDSM"
 !	"NormalSex"	"Beastiality"	"Group"
 !	"Lesbian"	"Service"	"Strip"
 !	"Combat"
 !
 ! All the "activate when foo > X" type triggers have a "Threshold"
 ! attribute which specifies the value of "X"
 !
 ! If the type is "Status" the possible values are:
 !
 !	"Poisoned"     		Her health will slowly decrease 
 !	"BadlyPoisoned"    	Her health will quickly decrease 
 !	"Pregnant"		She is pregnant
 !	"PregnantByPlayer"  	She is pregnant with the players child
 !	"Slave"			She is a slave 
 !	"HasDaughter"  		She has a daughter
 !	"HasSon"		She has a son
 !	"Inseminated"		Pregnant by a beast or creature
 !	"Controled"		Subject to some obedience spell effect
 !	"Catacombs"		Means this girl can be found in the catacombs
 !
 ! The other trigger attribute is "Has" and can be "True" or "False"
 ! according to whether the girl does or does not have the status in
 ! question. I'm not clear if this triggers each week (too much)
 ! or on the status changing (in which case the wording is confusing).
 ! "Has" defaults to "True"
 !
 ! "Meet" has a "Where" attribute with values:
 !
 !	"Town"			Player finds girl wandering round town
 !	"Catacombs"		Goons(?) find girl in catacombs
 !	"SlaveMarket"		Player finds girl for sale at market
 !
 ! "Talk" has a "Where attribute as well:
 !
 !	"Dungeon"		In the dungeon
 !	"Brothel"		In the Brothel (header says "Details screen"
 !				but you can access details screen from both
 !				so I'm guessing Brothel
 !
 ! "GlobalFlag" has a "Flag" attribute
 !
 !	"NoPay"			Customer can't/won't pay
 !	"GirlDies"		Girl dies in dungeon (or elsewhere, I assume)
 !	"CustomerDies"		Customer dies in dungeon 
 !	"GamblingCheat"		Customer caught cheating at gaming tables
 !	"RivalLose"		One of your rivals is brought before you
 !
 ! "Money" has a "Threshold" atribute as well as "Comparison" and
 ! "Who". "Who" can be "Player" or "Girl" (there are two separate
 ! triggers internally) and comparison is "LessThan" or "MoreThan".
 ! There are no "greater than or equal to" variants.
 !
 ! "ScriptRun" can trigger on one or two scripts having run. 
 ! The ScriptRun parameters are undocumented numbers, so for now
 ! I can offer no guidance on their use. Safest to ignore this for now.
 !
 ! Some attributes are common to all trigger types:
 !
 ! "Times" is how many times the trigger has fired so far.
 ! This will be ignored when loading the config file until someone
 ! explains why it should be otherwise.
 !
 ! "Chance" is %chance to trigger firing. Omitted, it defaults to 100
 !
 ! "OnceOnly" is "True" or "False" according to whether or not a 
 ! trigger should be disabled after its first firing. Defaults to "False"
 !
 ! "File" is the script file to execute when the trigger fires.
 !
 ! Examples:
 ! =========
 !
 ! Here are a few examples of the different trigger types.
 ! Mainly they're here to illustrate the syntax, but there are
 ! some suggestions as to the sort of effects you could create
 ! These are only possibilities, and far from the only ones.
 !
 ! This has a 1% chance to occur every turn. The "%" on the chance
 ! field can be omitted
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type	= "Random"
 !		File	= "RandomExample.script"
 !		Chance	= "1%"
 ! />
 !
 ! To make the same event only happen once, add a OnceOnly attribute
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type	= "Random"
 !		File	= "RandomExample.script"
 !		Chance	= "1%"
 !		OnceOnly= "True"
 ! />
 !
 ! To make a trigger that fires every round, leave off the Chance field
 ! so it defaults to 100%
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type	= "Random"
 !		File	= "RandomExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! Shopping triggers when the girl shops in her free time
 ! at the brothel. You could use this to make a kelptomaniac
 ! girl, who was forever being caught shoplifting. 
 ! Or a witch with an unfortunate knack for finding cursed
 ! artifacts in the bargain bin at Thaumaturgical Supplies...
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type	= "Shopping"
 !		File	= "ShoppingExample.script"
 !		Chance	= "10%"
 ! />
 ! 
 ! Skill: triggers when calue exceeds a threshold. There
 ! Doesn't seem to be a way to check for it dropping below a
 ! certain value.
 !
 ! You could use this to make a girl who trains her combat skill to
 ! 100% and then: "H'lo. My name is Iniga Montoya. You raped my mother
 ! Prepare to die"
 ! 
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Skill"
 !		Skill		= "Combat"
 !		Threshold	= "100"
 !		File		= "SkillExample.script"
 !		OnceOnly	= "True"
 ! />
 !
 ! Stats work the same way: Here's a girl who eventually tries,
 ! unsuccessfully, to open a portal to her home dimension once
 ! her mana reaches 70 or higher.
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Stat"
 !		Stat		= "Mana"
 !		Threshold	= "70"
 !		Chance		= "20%"
 !		File		= "StatExample.script"
 !		OnceOnly	= "True"
 ! />
 !
 ! ... and who will also *sucessfully* open a portal and teleport home
 ! just as soon as her mana gets to 100. (You'd have to watch that one...)
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Stat"
 !		Stat		= "Mana"
 !		Threshold	= "100"
 !		Chance		= "50%"
 !		File		= "StatExample2.script"
 !		OnceOnly	= "True"
 ! />
 !
 ! Status: How about a robot girl whose mechanical nature quickly shorts out
 ! magical necklaces of control and the like?
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Status"
 !		Status		= "Controlled"
 !		Has		= "True"
 !		Chance		= "35%"
 !		File		= "StatusExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! Money: Maybe a girl goes begging the player for pocket money
 ! if she runs short. This could get annoying really quickly...
 ! Comparison can be "LessThan" or "MoreThan". >= and <=
 ! equivalents don't exist, but that shouldn't matter.
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Money"
 !		Who		= "Girl"
 !		Threshold	= "10"
 !		Comparison	= "LessThan"
 !		Chance		= "3%"
 !		File		= "MoneyExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! You can write money triggers for the player as well
 ! Maybe have a salesman that comes to visit if cash exceeds
 ! 100k
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Money"
 !		Who		= "Player"
 !		Threshold	= "100000"
 !		Comparison	= "MoreThan"
 !		Chance		= "3%"
 !		File		= "MoneyExample2.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! Meet: this is the trigger that fires when you find Cammy
 ! wandinging around Crossgate: Let's think of something
 ! different to do...
 !
 ! Suppose a catacomb squad found a demon girl who 
 ! asked for their protection because something
 ! really, really scary was chasing her. So the Squad
 ! captain, not having any orders covering this occurence
 ! brought her back so you could talk to her. Are you
 ! going to put her to work? brand her? throw her back?
 ! And is there *really* something scary following her?
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Meet"
 !		Where		= "Catacomb"
 !		File		= "MeetExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! 
 ! Talk: use this to override a girl's interaction
 ! options in the brothel or dungeon.
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Talk"
 !		Where		= "Bothel"
 !		File		= "TalkExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! WeeksPast: Have something happen after she's been
 ! working for you for so many weeks. Maybe this girl
 ! starts asking to be freed (or to retire) after she's
 ! been in the business a couple of years...
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "WeeksPast"
 !		Threshold	= "102"
 !		Chance		= "3%"
 !		File		= "WeeksPastExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! GlobalFlag: fairly straight forward. How about a script to
 ! give you the option of having a dead girl resurrected?
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "GirlDies"
 !		File		= "WeeksPastExample.script"
 ! />
 !
 ! Last one: kidnapped. Let's you make something interesting happen
 ! when a girl is abducted. No special parameters.
 !
 ! <Trigger	Type		= "Kidnapped"
 !		File		= "KidnapExample.script"
 ! />
