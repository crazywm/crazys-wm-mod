      Desc="Despite looking like an innocent book of romantic poetry, this ancient tome has the power to sap its reader's mental defenses and sense of self. Most of its mind-controlling power is gone now, but it still leaves the reader noticeably more susceptible to the influence of others, and more receptive to submissive sexual acts. (+30 Obed, -30 Spi, +20 BDSM, +10 Anal, Group, Oral, Hand)"
