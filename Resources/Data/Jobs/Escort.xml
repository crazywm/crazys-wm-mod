                ${name} has been assigned to work as an Escort. She is informed that various men will ask for her to accompany them on dates,
                whether because they need a date for a social engagement of some kind or because of their own loneliness.
                Her skills in service, her beauty, her charisma, her intelligence, and her refinement may all be tested to provide the ideal date that each client requests.
                And, of course, should she decide to spend some \"extra\" time with the client, she will need to perform well with each of their sexual proclivities.
                This is her choice, however.

                ${name} has some particularly aggressive tendencies that make her a poor choice for patrons seeking polite conversation.
                Even if she carries a conversation well, the undercurrent of restrained hostility will detract from her performance.

                ${name} is a complete ditz.
                Her repertoire of conversation is limited to her favorite dresses and her many powerful feelings on makeup brands.
                This will stymie her abilities as an escort, no matter how well she does otherwise.

                ${name} is very shy with new people. For a job that requires meeting with new people constantly,
                this is a bad trait to possess.
                Her nervousness will translate into some awkward conversational moments, no matter how great her charisma is.

                ${name} is retarded, and this is a natural obstacle to most conversations.
                For those men that do not want a prolonged conversation on her favorite colors or a description of her last "poopy,"
                which is the vast majority of men, she may have some trouble as an escort.

                ${name} has some psychic abilities, meaning she has a natural advantage in conversation.

                This may come in very handy.

            a man who has called on her before and now is willing to pay extra for a special assignation.
            His new boss has asked the client out for a double date with the client's girlfriend and his own wife so he can get to know his new employee better.
            The problem is that the client does not have a girlfriend.
            ${name} is to arrive at a local restaurant, equipped with a suitable dress and pair of shoes,
            ready to chat amiably.

                She read the biography that your escort clients are obligated to provide,

                ${name} is not merely beautiful, she is absolutely stunning. The client knows this already,

                he is able to focus on his boss, who is practically drooling himself.
                The wife moves uncomfortably in her seat as this moment draws out longer.
                "My goodness," says the boss to the client. "You certainly did well for yourself!"
                What only ${name} can see during their little exchange, however,
                is that the wife continues shifting in her chair uncomfortably,
                staring deep into her eyes while casually rubbing her lips with one finger. Interesting.

                the client is pleased by the wink of congratulations that his boss shares with him a moment later.
                What neither the boss nor the client see, however, is the long interested stare that the wife gives her.
                There is an interest in that glance that goes beyond the professional kind.

            the focus of the attention tonight is not on ${name} but on her client,
            and her only role is to appear supportive of her "boyfriend" in front of her boss,
            and to make their relationship believable.
            <Text Condition="skill:Service>98">
                ${name} knows everything about this fictitious relationship.
                She also knows about the details of the job that the client just got,
                and is able to talk with great specificity about the circumstances of their meeting,
                where they enjoy going on dates, and how proud she was when he came home to tell her about his new job.

            <Text Condition="skill:Service<99^skill:Service>75">
                Given the amount of research that ${name} conducted prior to arriving, the relationship is easily believable.
                She knows everything about the two of them, and is able to describe with great accuracy how they met,
                and all of their previous dates.
                When the conversation drifts towards her job,
                she is able to provide substantial details about her fictitious employment.

                Fortunately, ${name}'s study of their relationship before arriving gives her plenty of details.
                Whenever the conversation drifts towards their own history,
                such as where they met and what they like to do together,
                she is able to provide the answers that the client expects,
                which makes the process run smoothly.
                She has to invent quite a bit about her own job, however.

                She is forced to improvise the remainder,

                and the client looks on with dismay at her wild answers to
                questions before he resigns himself to the situation and begins following her lead,
                trying to make it all up as he goes.

                The two of them are thoroughly persuaded that the relationship is real,

                She shares her part of the conversation like she is reading from a hidden teleprompter.
                Fortunately, while her performance is not very convincing,
                the client is able to keep everything believable,

                every sentence she speaks about their relationship sounds forced and fake.
                The boss and his wife share a suspicious glance at one point before the client intervenes and

                ${name} suspects that her work as a porn star may mean that he certainly has seen her before,

                Consequently, she detects a certain vibe coming from the boss's wife throughout the dinner that she recognizes pretty quickly.
                The two of them share some lingering looks that the men do not see or understand,
                but they know that there is the potential for something here tonight.

                The four of them are laughing like old friends by the time the bill arrives,
                and ${name} can feel looks of attraction and lust coming her way from the client,
                which is expected, and from the boss, which is a nice bonus.
                She can also feel them coming from the boss's wife, which was something she had not expected this evening,
                but the looks were strong enough that she was not completely surprised when the wife looked knowingly at her husband and whispered something in his ear.
                He smiles for a second and then looks at his new employee and ${name}.
                "I know this may be a bit unorthodox," he begins,
                "but we've been having a great evening, and we wanted to know if.. maybe.. the two of you wanted to keep the night going at our place?"
                The client looks at ${name} with surprise and amazement, but then thinks about it and smiles.
                His look changes to that of an open question, meaning that he will take ${name}'s lead on the answer.

                As the dinner comes to a pleasant close, the client says all his goodbyes and escorts ${name} out the door.
                "As always," he says once they are alone, "you are amazing.
                I can't believe that worked. Here is your fee, plus some extra for making this all work.
                So.. uh.." he continues,
                "do you want to keep the fiction going for a bit and come back to my place for a celebratory drink?"

                As the dinner comes to a close, the client fidgets and looks for excuses for the two of them to leave.
                As soon as one appears, he escorts ${name} quickly out of the restaurant.
                "I can't believe that worked," he says, nervously, "but it almost didn't.
                Thanks, but let's just call it a night. Take your fee," he whispers,
                discreetly handing her an envelope with her payment.
                "I'll tell them you had a work thing tonight and go chat some more. Thanks,"
                he says dismissively as he turns back towards the restaurant.

                The dinner ends with the boss and his wife sharing a skeptical glance as the client hurries ${name} out the door to an imaginary late-night work assignment.
                "That was absolutely terrible,"
                he whispers ferociously to her when they are alone outside.
                "Now I have to go back in and do damage control. For all I know, you may have just cost me my job.
                Maybe that's my fault for taking this risk with you, but I can definitely tell you one thing:
                I will not be paying for this. Tell your boss that he needs to be much more careful with his assignments in the future."
                He turns angrily on his heels, composes himself, and reenters the restaurant,
                leaving ${name} to walk back to your establishment, asking herself about the myriad things she did wrong.

                ${name} is savvy enough to know what they are suggesting,
                but is too conservative in her morals to consider having sex with all of them.
                She politely declines, much to the client's regret, but tells them that she did have a wonderful evening.
                The client escorts her outside and thanks her for her incredible performance.
                "I know that the group offer might not be your thing," he says,
                "but I thought maybe you and I might keep our little fake relationship going for another hour or two,
                if you're interested," he concludes, waiting hopefully for her answer.

                ${name} politely considers the offer, but the fact of the matter is that she has no interest in sex with anyone tonight.
                She invents an excuse about having a work event to get to, apologizing profusely,
                but suggesting that maybe the four of them grab another dinner sometime soon.
                The client is surprised at the suggestion, since it means that he may have to pay for another group date with his "girlfriend,"
                but he is hardly angry, as the possibility of fucking his boss's wife is a bit too enticing for him to ignore.
                The client escorts her outside and discreetly hands her an envelope with a substantial tip for her excellent work tonight.

            ${name} smiles at the offer, and leans a bit over the table before answering. "I think we would love to join you," she says.
            They all grin with anticipation, getting up to leave.
            As they walk out the door, ${name} leaves the client's side for a moment to speak to the wife.
            "I think you should know," she whispers, "that I am still a virgin, and that the two of us have decided to wait until marriage."
            The wife appears disappointed, but livens as ${name} continues:
            "This doesn't mean that the two of us can't get to know each other a little better at your place, though.
            As long as the boys know that my body is off limits, I think we could still have a very enjoyable evening."
            The wife smiles and turns to whisper something to her husband while ${name} discreetly informs the client of the arrangement.
            He smiles as well, and the four of them soon arrive at a lovely expensive home,
            where they soon begin undressing themselves around a large bed.

            Within minutes, the wife has her lips wrapped around her husband's cock as the client spears her ass.
            She writhes in pleasure, pulling ${name}'s head towards her open pussy.

                She is truly a master at cunnilingus, and by the time the men have exploded their semen into the sweaty woman,
                she is screaming with passion on her fifth powerful orgasm, spraying her juices everywhere.
                They all lie panting on the bed afterwards, with the wife purring in ecstasy.

                sometimes enjoying a cock in her mouth and another in her ass as the wife fists her with reckless abandon.
                Both women have orgasmed at least a handful of times by the time the men pull out of them,

                "but you definitely do not belong. I don't think I've ever spent so much money to be humiliated in public.
                Please tell your employer that I will not be paying for this evening,
                and that he should be more careful in his choice of companions for future assignments.
                I bid you good night," he concludes, his voice quivering with anger, as he pays the bill and walks out into the night.

                "Maybe you'd like to get to know them a bit better, too," she continues, using her other hand to free his cock from his pants.
                ${name} disappears briefly into his kitchen and returns a moment later carrying a jar.
                "I found some olive oil - I hope you don't mind if I borrow some," she smiles.
                "Not at all," he pants in response, eagerly waiting.
                Soon she has lathered up her breasts in oil and is rubbing them up and down his cock while she moans seductively.

                and it is not until he takes over and starts thrusting himself into her that he is able to build towards orgasm.
                ${name}'s gag reflex suddenly kicks in, though, which is probably why she was staying so shallow on the tip in the first place,
                and she is soon coughing all over his cock and pulling herself away to recover.
                This kills the mood for a period,
                and it is not until she regains composure and the client masturbates himself into her mouth that he is able to cum.
                The whole experience leaves him slightly disappointed.

                Wordlessly, ${name} lowers herself to her knees and begins unbuttoning the client's pants.
                She grins and begins licking his erection.
                He sighs with satisfaction and prepares to enjoy the blowjob until he realizes that she has absolutely no idea what she is doing.
                She licks the cock like it is a lollipop, with the skill of a virgin and the enthusiasm of a dog going after peanut butter.
                Disaster strikes, however, when she tries to swallow his cock into her throat and her pronounced gag reflex kicked in.
                The gagging, combined with the alcohol from the bar, triggers instant and projectile vomit all over the client's cock.
                "Oh no!" cries ${name}  as she recovers from her retching, staring in horror at the client,
                who is silently gazing at the pile of puke covering him.
                "I'm so sorry! I'm so so so sorry," she continues looking around for something to wipe it all up.
                After a few minutes of mopping the vomit from his crotch, ${name} awkwardly pulls her clothes together and prepares to leave,
                painfully aware that the client will not be getting another erection any time soon.
                "I'm so embarrassed," she whimpers as she moves for the door.

                and puts her masterful oral skills to work.
                She takes him deeply in one swallow and holds him there,
                locked in her as she swallows repeatedly to massage him with her throat.
                She stays there, intentionally depriving herself of oxygen for his pleasure,
                until she feels him building towards orgasm.
                She then releases, teasing him. "Not yet," she whispers before turning her phenomenal tongue to his balls.
                She returns to his shaft as he recovers himself, and then slowly and masterfully builds the tension until she knows the time is approaching.
                She then plunges herself deep onto his cock again, licking his balls as her throat plays around his tip,
                until he shoots a violent explosion of cum straight down to her stomach.
                "That was absolutely incredible," moans the client as he collapses onto his couch.

                The client moans with pleasure as she expertly works around his manhood,

                It is not the best blowjob he has ever received, but it is nevertheless very pleasurable,

                The client groans with pleasure, and ${name} keeps sucking the tip of his cock. And keeps sucking.
                For minutes. She does not vary her technique, or move to lick or suck anything else, or take the cock deeper into her mouth.
