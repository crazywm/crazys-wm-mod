                ${name} refused to perform in an Anal scene today. "That's not how I wanted this to be," you say,
                "but I've got bills to pay. Boys, tie her up!" Seeing her terrified expression, you call out to her co-star.
                "Be gentle with her, will ya!".

            "No, I'm not doing this!", ${name} complains. Ignoring her pleading, your men roughly tie her up. "It seems
            like a lesson in obedience is in order here", you say as you hand a gigantic dildo to the
            actor. Turning to her with an evil grin on you face, you add "No foreplay, no lube!"

                Given ${name}'s rather 'unenthusiastic' performance, the scene turned out decent enough.

                ${name} is just laying there, totally unresponsive except for a few whimpers and cries.
                Not a good scene.

            <Text Condition="Performance<125^stat:Spirit>=60">
                Despite being tied up, ${name} managed to hurt the other actor. Needless to say, the scene
                turned out rather bad.

            <Text Condition="Performance<50">
                While tying her up made it possible to film this scene, the result looks so bad that maybe you should
                have just sent her to the dungeon instead.
