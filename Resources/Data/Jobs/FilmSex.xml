                ${name} refused to get fucked on film today. "That's not how I wanted this to be," you say,

                "No, I'm not doing this!", ${name} complains. Ignoring her pleading, your men tie her up. "It seems
                like a lesson in obedience is in order here", you say and turning to her co-star, you add "Pound her hard! And no foreplay!"

                Given ${name}'s rather 'unenthusiastic' performance, the scene turned out decent enough.

                ${name} is just laying there, totally unresponsive except for a few whimpers and cries.
                Not a good scene.

            <Text Condition="Performance<125^stat:Spirit>=60">
                Despite being tied up, ${name} managed to hurt the other actor. Needless to say, the scene
                turned out rather bad.

            <Text Condition="Performance<50">
                While tying her up made it possible to film this scene, the result looks so bad that maybe you should
                have just sent her to the dungeon instead.
