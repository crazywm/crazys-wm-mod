            She's unbelievable at this and is always getting praised by the customers for her playing skills.
            <Text>Her playing fills the room. Some customers hum the melody under their noses.</Text>
            <Text>After making a mistake she improvised a passage to the next song.</Text>

            Her playing is really good and gets praised by the customers often.
            <Text>Her playing was pleasing, if bland.  Her rhythm was nice, if slightly untrained.</Text>
            <Text>${name} doesn't have any trouble playing the piano.</Text>
            <Text>Give ${name} any kind of music sheet and she will play it. She is really good at this.</Text>

            She hits a few right notes but she still has room to improve.

            <Text>${name}'s performance today was good. She is a promising pianist.</Text>
            <Text>She gets the key order right most of the time.</Text>

                The slow song ${name} played at the end of shift really had her full emotion and heart.
                A pity that she felt so bored and tired.

            She almost never hits a right note. Lucky for you most of the customers are too drunk and horny to care.
            <Text>She is terrible at this. Some customers left after she started to play.</Text>
            <Text>You could count on the fingers of one hand the part in her performance that was clean.</Text>
            <Text>She is bad at playing the piano.</Text>
            <Text>${name} knows a note. Too bad it's the only one she knows and plays it over and over.</Text>
            <Text>
                Her playing is barely acceptable,
                but fortunately the bustling of the bar drowns ${name} out for the most part.

            She didn't play the piano so much as banged on it.
            <Text>
                Her audience seems paralyzed, as if they couldn't believe that a piano was capable of making such noise.

                After ten seconds you wanted to grab an axe and end the instrument's misery under ${name}'s
                attempt to play.
            </Text>
            <Text>Nobody else would call this random key-mashing 'playing', but ${name} thinks otherwise.</Text>
            <Text>When ${name} started to play, the bar emptied almost instantly. This could be useful in a fire.</Text>
            <Text>${name} banged on the piano clearly having no clue which note was which.</Text>
