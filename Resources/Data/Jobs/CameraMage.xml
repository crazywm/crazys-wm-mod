                ${name} is a true magician behind the camera.
                She manages to capture every moment perfectly. Future generations of camera mages will
                study her work and use it as reference to aspire to.

            <Text>${name} is a great cinematomancer. Wide angles, close ups, fast movement, she has a spell for each
            situation, and uses them to great artistic effect.</Text>

            <Text>${name} is a great camera mage. Her recording spells work well in most studio conditions, even
            though she still has some difficulties with bad lighting and quick movements. </Text>

            <Text>${name} did decent camera work today. No artistic masterpiece, to be sure, but the image
            is sharp and steady. </Text>

        <Message Name="work.bad">
            <Text>${name}'s cinematomancy still needs some work. She can produce a stable picture, but
                it often is out of focus and blurry.

            <Text>${name} is barely able to perform the recording spell. The resulting image is flickering,
            shaky and blurry.</Text>
