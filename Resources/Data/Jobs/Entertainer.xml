            She must be the perfect entertainer customers go on and on about her and always come to see her when she works.

                The heat of her passion and strength of her fierce nature make ${name}'s

            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                ${name}'s very appearance in the door of the gambling hall leads to
                applause and the sudden appearance of a clear way to the stage steps.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                You feel inexpressibly proud that ${name}, your daughter, is such a skilled entertainer.

            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                There is no way to resist the raw charisma ${name} practically exudes,
                drawing everybody around her towards her stage.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Every one of ${name}'s jokes elicits a wave of laughter from the crowd of patrons,
                many of whom have no interest in gambling.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her voice is that of an angel, and her humor is as sharp and cutting as a blade.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Each shift, ${name} ends her show by blowing a kiss to her fans,
                producing waves of applause and cheers.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                She could probably excel in any club or entertainment center - fortunately,
                ${name}'s in yours, drawing customers.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} is downright ideal for this job.  Her presentation and material are flawless.

        </Message>
        <Message Name="work.great">
            She's unbelievable at this and is always getting praised by the customers for her work.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                The savagery of ${name}'s temper has honed her wit to a razor's edge,
                letting her jab away at the audience and still rake in the tips.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                She cooly paces the edge of the stage as she sings,
                each step deliberate and perfectly poised,
                as if ${name} was some noble pacing her seat of power.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                While her technical skills could use improvement, ${name}'s delivery is beyond reproach.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                ${name} isn't perfect, but she's your own flesh and blood, which is more then close enough.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} begun to acquire her own following -
                a small crowd of people came in just to listen to her and buy drinks.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her jokes are almost always funny as ${name}'s repertoire develops and expands.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name}'s arrival on the stage at the beginning of her shift is greeted by scattered applause
                by the last few gamblers from the previous shift, and the new clients.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name}'s soothing voice seems to glide over the noise and bustling of the gamblers and dealers.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Each shift the tips ${name} collects seem to grow in size!
            </Text>
        </Message>
        <Message Name="work.good">
            She's good at this job and gets praised by the customers often.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                Her jokes are a bit more violent than they perhaps should be,
                but the clients seem to like ${name}.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                The elegance ${name} brings to all things enhances her already pleasant singing.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                While ${name}'s repertoire of jokes and other amusements could stand expansion,
                she's got the presentation down pat.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                Though you'll never admit it, you're happy that ${name} has carved out a niche that doesn't
                involve renting her cunt to public servants.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                A couple of gamblers parted with some of their hard-earned
                winnings after swearing that her singing had brought them luck.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} earned a decent tip today for her sincere,
                if not always effective, attempts to entertain the clients.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her singing was pleasing, if bland.  Her voice was nice, if slightly untrained.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Most of the jokes ${name} told were amusing.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} managed to provide amusement for anybody who happened to listen to her.

        <Message Name="work.ok">
            She made a few mistakes but overall she is okay at this.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                While ${name}'s jokes tend to fall flat,
                nobody seems to have the bravery to tell her that.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Elegant" Chance="50">
                Her air of sophistication lets ${name} get away with telling boring jokes.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                The tips she received were far more than ${name}'s skills had any reason to bring in.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                ${name} isn't impressive in any way, but she is your daughter,
                so you dutifully clap as she descends from the stage.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                The slow song ${name} sang at the end of shift really had her full emotion and heart.
                A pity that she felt so bored and tired.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                While most of the jokes ${name} tells are old and worn out, a few were rather amusing.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} monologued the guests for an hour or so.
                While nobody seemed particularly interested, nobody looked pissed either.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                While she won't win any contests, ${name} isn't a terrible singer.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} managed to elicit a few chuckles, and got a few tips.

        <Message Name="work.bad">
            She was nervous and made a few mistakes. She isn't that good at this.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                ${name} cursed the audience roundly for their dislike of her music.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                Even though her jokes were stale and boring,
                the audience couldn't seem to make themselves let ${name} down, and laughed regardless.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                You wonder if your daughter, child of your loins, might do better on her back then on the stage.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                For all the reaction she's getting, you could probably replace ${name} with a simple mannequin.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} doesn't appear to be enjoying herself, an emotion she has in common with the clientele.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name} tells bland jokes and sings forgettable songs.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her singing is barely acceptable,
                but fortunately the bustling of the gambling hall drowns ${name} out for the most part.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                While her jokes aren't actually driving anyone off, nobody seems to find her entertaining either.

            She was nervous and constantly making mistakes. She really isn't very good at this job.

            <Text Condition="Aggressive" Chance="50">
                When the crowd booed her,
                ${name} responded by throwing a shoe at one of the loudest and most insulting members.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Fearless" Chance="50">
                Despite the crowd's displeasure, ${name} keeps herself cool and collected,
                apparently unaffected by their ire.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Clumsy" Chance="50">
                ${name} trips and falls flat on her face when climbing up the stage stairs.
                The crowd cheers loudly.

            <Text Condition="Massive Melons|Abnormally Large Boobs|Titanic Tits|Big Boobs|Busty Boobs|Giant Juggs" Chance="33">
                You have a feeling if she wasn't so well-endowed no one would show up for her show.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Charming|Charismatic" Chance="50">
                The poor quality of her routine was offset by her natural charisma.
            </Text>
            <Text Condition="Your Daughter" Chance="50">
                As ${name} butchers another song,
                you feel bitterly ashamed by your relationship to your worthless child.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                You stuck your head into the hall halfway through shift,
                and swore off the gin for the third time this week after hearing ${name}'s horrible singing.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                She managed to aggravate several customers with her poor taste in jokes.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                ${name}'s as funny as a peasant uprising and about as appreciated by her audience.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                For some reason, ${name} attempted a dramatic monologue and feigned suicide on stage.
                Needless to say, she didn't receive any tips.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Her audience seems paralyzed, as if they couldn't believe that a human body could produce those sounds,
                much less call them "singing".
