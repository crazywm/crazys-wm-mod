            She almost never hits a right note. Lucky for you most of your customers are drunks.

                Her singing is barely acceptable, but fortunately the bustling of the bar drowns ${name} out
                for the most part.

            <Text>${name} singing was awful. Not a single line was sung clearly.</Text>

            <Text>It's tragic, ${name} really can't sing.</Text>
            <Text>${name} singing was awful. Angry listeners throw random objects at her.</Text>
            <Text>Hearing ${name}'s singing gave you a thought to use it as a new torture method.</Text>
            <Text>${name} bellowed out a melody that caused the bar to go into a panic clearing it quickly.</Text>
            <Text>
                Her audience seems paralyzed, as if they couldn't believe that a human body could produce those sounds,
                much less call them "singing".

                ${name} was the first to get on stage before today's star performance.
