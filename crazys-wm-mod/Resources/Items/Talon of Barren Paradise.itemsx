      Desc="When this sharply-clawed finger is inserted into a girl's vagina, strange magic causes it to start twisting around. While oddly painless, it modifies the girl's anatomy to work solely for pleasure. She'll no longer have a usable womb, but her vagina is significantly altered and enhanced. It develops a number of twists and ridges, and her nerve endings become far more exposed and sensitive. Unfortunately, greatly increased hormones may affect her in other ways.(+Sterile, +Fast Orgasms, +50 Norm, -30 Obed, -10 Con, +10 Fear/Hate)"
