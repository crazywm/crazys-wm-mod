<Item Name="Slippery Orb"    
      Desc="Despite it's name, this tiny, magic orb is quite easy to grasp. When inserted into a girl's vagina, however, it causes her natural lubrication to increase tremendously. It doesn't increase desire in any way, but it does cause a girl to stay continuously wet, making sex better and more comfortable for both parties. The orb will work it's way into the uterus and stay there for a few weeks, but will eventually dissolve from all the increased moisture. (+25 Normal / Group Sex, -2 Fear)"
