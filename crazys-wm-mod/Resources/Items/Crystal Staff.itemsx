<Item Name="Crystal Staff"
      Desc="This long wooden staff is clearly the tool of a wizard. One end bears a fist-sized translucent crystal; it serve as a focus for arcane energy, but it also adds extra power to its wielder's spells. Curiously, after a few weeks of use, the crystal attunes to its owner and glows different colors depending on their mood. (C) (+20 Mag, +6 Comb, +8 Conf, -16 Fear, -8 Hate)"
