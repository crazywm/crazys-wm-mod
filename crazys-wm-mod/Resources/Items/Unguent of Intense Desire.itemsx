<Item Name="Unguent of Intense Desire"    
      Desc="After rubbing this gel into a girl's clit and vagina, she'll develop an irreversible need for constant sexual release. This need is worsened by an unpleasant side effect -- a permanent loss of sensitivity. With a lot of effort, she can occasionally still have an orgasm. However, it's never truly satisfying, and she'll constantly struggle to live with such intense desire. As a result of so much frustration, she's also likely to be more wild and harder to control. (+Nymphomaniac, +Slow Orgasms, -30 Obedience, -10 Love. +10 Hate)"
