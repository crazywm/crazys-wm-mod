### Changes before 12/27/2015
I kindof dropped out of working on the game because work was draining me too much mentally and physically.
As a result I did not work on the game at all for 2 months but other people did.
Much of what they have done I have not really gone through yet so I can't really comment on it for now.
Several new image types and a few new jobs have been added as well as a lot of new texts for jobs.


### Changes 12/27/2015 - I'm back :)
Added color configuration to text items in interface xmls
* Add Red, Green and Blue tags to the<Text>block with numbers 0-255 to add hex colors
**<Text Name="Label1" Text="Brothel Name" XPos="32" YPos="32" Width="128" Height="32" FontSize="16" Red="250" Green="0" Blue="0" />
Added popup_message.xml to the interface so it can be customized.

### Changes 10/16/2016
Merged in Pull request #15 by mjsmagalhaes
 - Try to achieve a better balance for the harsher form of torture.
 - - Feel free to change that if it has gone too much for either side.
 - Make the item sales multiplier in the config file effective.
 - - Also update the sell price in the Item Management screen
 - Expose the remaining duration of the Kidnapped trait to the (dungeon) interface.
 - - To achieve this i've made a member from cGirls (HasTempTrait) static because i had no instance of that class available. It would be better to add something similar to sGirl or, even better IMHO, to make them share a base class. But those two might be a lot of trouble comparing with the current change.
 - - - `J` I changed this part to make it work better
 
Added list box hotkeys to all buildings
