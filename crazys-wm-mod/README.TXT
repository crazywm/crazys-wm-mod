Please distribute this game among all the people you think will enjoy the game
However be sure to include all files including this file.

How you can help keep this program alive and in development.
There are several ways

- Come up with features or changes you would like added. This is important since your
feedback is very important to the development of the game. Any ideas that players come up
with that are not stupid will be added to my list of things to add. I expect to release new
versions of the game at least every 2 weeks. The amount added in these releases will vary
according to the time I am able to spend on the game since I am currently unemployed and 
spending alot of time looking for work. However (even though unlikely) if donations are
enough then I will spend more time on development.

- Spread this game. Give it to everyone who will probably like to play it. When you do
make sure you include this file as the whole point of spreading the game is so more people
can contribtue ideas or donations.

- Add your own girls and stories. This game is designed to be added to. That means you can
add your own girls, images, and scripts (making your own little stories).
