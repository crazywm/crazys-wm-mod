 * I don't generally see the point of using chars over ints
 * for stat values - most PCs have more than enough memory to make the
 * space considerations trivial.
 *
 * that said, this would be an easy change to a template class
 * if we did want a char based version. Then a sBoundedVar would
 * use three times the memory of a char rather than 12 times, which
 * could be important if we're looking at porting to other platforms
 *
 * We could use static constants for the min and max values as well,
 * although we'd need a new subclass for each set of bounds and then to 
 * override the constants. Then of course we'd probably need a virtual accessor
 * to make sure we got the right constants ... and then the vtable would 
 * wipe out any savings in memory from the two ints (or chars).
 *
 * probably easier to stick with three values, all told.
