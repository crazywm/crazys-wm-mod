I wanted to make it like other buildings

Shepherd - up to job performance *10
Rancher - up to job performance
Catacomb Rancher - up to job performance /10
 - any above that may die (vet reduces the chance to die)


Skills: 
Farming
Animal Handling
Herbalism
Crafting
Brewing

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Need to track:
Food crops
food animals by size
beast animals - already in
potion ingredients by quality
beer/wine in production by quality

You must have at least 5 food animals in a size category to add more through natural production.
 - natural production of food animals (number += (int)number/5)

You must have at least 10 beasts to add more through natural production
 - natural production of beasts (number += (int)number/10)

food animals by size:
0 - eggs - 1 food each - counted as 0.1 animal
1 - chicken - 2 food each
2 - goat - 3 food each
3 - sheep - 4 food each
4 - ostrich - 5 food each
5 - cow - 6 food each






Add items when finished:
Various Food items already in the game
beer/wine
Milk - normal
Milk - beast
Milk - by girl type
Succubus Milk - already in - chance to be produced by demon girl milk
Any type of potion when potion ingredients of a certain quality reaches a set amount and random chance

Girl upkeep can be reduced by food produced - extra food can then be sold
Antipreg potions and healing potions for gangs can be restocked


Farm management page:
check boxes for garden qualities
check boxes for potion types
Buy and sell buttons for crops, food animals, beasts
 - hops, grapes, herbs, potion ingredients
 
 
Garden qualities
0 - weeds - grows if no gardener is on duty - has a chance of lowering value of other things in the garden or killing them
1 - easy - open at start - buy 50 for 1 gold - sell 100 for 1 gold
2 - simple - open at start - buy 5 for 1 - sell 10 for 1
3 - common - open at start - buy 1 for 2 - sell 1 for 1
4 - uncommon -     each researcher adds 10% chance each week -     buy 1 for 20 - sell 1 for 10
5 - special -      each researcher adds 1% chance each week -      buy 1 for 200 - sell 1 for 100
6 - very special - each researcher adds 0.1% chance each week -    buy 1 for 2000
7 - rare -         each researcher adds 0.01% chance each week -   buy 1 for 20000
8 - very rare -    each researcher adds 0.001% chance each week -  buy 1 for 200000
9 - unique -       each researcher adds 0.0001% chance each week - buy 1 for 2000000
% chance is started at 0.0000 from the first turn the player acquires the farm not from when the previous quality is unlocked
the previous quality must be unlocked before the next has a chance to be unlocked
use g_Roll%(int(chance)) so the chance is rounded down so 0.9999% is still 0%

20 researchers would take 10 game years to get unique chance to 1%
 by the time someone reached that (without cheating) we should have something that can use it :p



Random event - disease
With a vet on duty:
"An animal is found to have (anthrax, foot-and-mouth, mad-cow) and is removed from the heard."
Without a vet on duty:
"An animal is found to have (anthrax, foot-and-mouth, mad-cow) and several had to be put down to prevent it from spreading."

 
 

Change beast birth to send the newborn beast to the farm
eventually track the beast baby?
add get inseminated as a job to produce more beasts?
