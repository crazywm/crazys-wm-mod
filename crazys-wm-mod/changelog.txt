1.30.4 beta r593
* Updated Slider control code to now change position to wherever you click on the slider, instead of just increasing/decreasing by a set amount if you clicked to either side of the "button"
* Revamped scrollbar code to extricate it from being directly tied to listboxes
* Scrollbars on listboxes are now "clicky", meaning the bar itself sort of snaps up or down between actual positions instead of smoothly sliding up or down; this description might be confusing, but you'll probably notice the different feel
* Text which is too long to fit in the provided areas now have scrollbars automatically added; you can smoothly scroll pixel-by-pixel by dragging the bar, or scroll one line of text at a time by using the up/down buttons or your mouse scrollwheel
* fixed quite a few typos, mainly thanks to bj (http://pinkpetal.co.cc/index.php?topic=585.0)
* Animated images should now be completely supported, where support was semi-broken before
* Code which was supposed to cull old (no longer needed) images from memory has been fixed, so memory usage should be lower with extended play
Several changes by WonderDog, as follows:
* Torturer job and torturing in general has been updated and improved quite a bit
* Turn Summary message colors are updated based on severity of events and health o girls/gangs (dark blue or red)
* Weekly girl stat changes based on house percentage (obedience, fear, hate, happiness) are a bit more fluid
* some further code refactoring
Many many changes by myrikhan, as follows:
* High-quality sex acts (from skilled girls) now often give flavorful mad-libs style turn summary descriptions 
* Turn Summary screen message display order changed:
  - Girls with ciritical (red) messages are displayed first, followed by warnings (dark blue)
  - Within the message list itself, red messages are displayed first, then dark blue
* Worked in the security job:
  - Attackers who cause trouble to girls is now a group of 1-10 people. (I'm specifically NOT calling them gangs to avoid confusion.) They don't have healing potions or weapon levels.
  - The first layer of protection is one of the security guards.
  - If she is defeated, the second layer is defending gangs, if they pass the coverage check.
  - The third layer of defense is the girl herself.
  - Casualties to the attackers accumulate from layer to layer
  - Traits worked in to the security point calculation
  - Stopping a group of attackers costs (#attackers x 5) security points
  - Security points decay by 50 each round (To prevent banking in the early parts of the game.)
* Added Catacombs05 and Catacombs01 to rarity. Didn't change any items in the items file. (I figure we can do that over time if we like this change.)
* Improved and bugfixed the item use automation function
* Girl level cap raised to 999. Function modified to reflect this: Skill-ups occur for only the first 20 levels (same as before). This is cosmetic, as nothing depends on level, except girl sell price.
* Turned some repetitive code into functions
* Random bugfixes
* Added natural healing of 2% per shift for each girl. It is a flat 2% that isn't affected by traits like tough or fragile
  - Tried to add a 2% per shift reduction to tiredness, but it caused tiredness values to go to 100% unexpectedly, so it's commented out.
* Noticed that statuses like 'controlled' currently don't do anything. For a few of the items that add the 'controlled' status I added on to them the ability to remove the strong willed trait.
  - (eg: disguised slave band, necklace of control)

1.30.3 beta r485
* missing numerical config values now properly stay set to default values instead of reverting to 0
* girls with more than 30 traits would fuck things up (and probably fuck things in other directions, too)
* girls on maternity leave from giving birth no longer sneak in training on the sly
* "Have X gangs in Y weeks" objective fixed (no more "-1 gangs"), and time given is reduced
* Pregnant sex pics are now shown if available
* Cammy meet script was apparently corrupt; reverted
* WMEdit updated to support GirlMeet and SlaveHousePerc values
* anal sex no longer removes virginity
* group sex is now prohibited properly if you have it disabled
* SlaveHousePerc config option is now implemented in the game, so you can specify the default slave house-percentage
* girls who sustain injuries (scars, lost eye, lost pregnancy) now also lose 10 health in the process
* changing the house percentage slider for a girl now updates the Rebelliousness text on-the-fly
* Rebelliousness is now properly increased/decreased by House Percentage for non-slaves; anything above 60% increases rebelliousness, below 60% decreases it
* If you have no random monster girls in your .rgilrsx files for whatever reason (testing, major mod, whatever), the game no longer hangs when girls or gangs try to capture a monster girl in the catacombs
* new random girl name list with 5188 names from many world cultures; if you want to switch back to the name pack with 969 Japanese names, that file is also included
* girls defeated and raped by monsters in the catacombs can now potentially be inseminated if she isn't using anti-preg potions; chance of insemination is increased based on number of monsters

1.30.2 beta r452
* unique girls weren't being loaded on new games
	NOTE: if you started a new game in r450, you can fix this by opening the savegame's .gam.mast file and deleting the contents (don't delete the file itself, though, that will do nothing)
* navigating between girls with up/down arrow keys on the Turn Summary screen wasn't working
* bundled WMEdit is updated to 0.68b  --  provided as always by Solo761
* add "GirlMeet" config value to config.xml, which is the chance you'll meet a girl when walking around town
* potential crash on Girl Details screen fixed

1.30.1 beta r450
* event scripting can use Lua scripts now
* permanent stat modifications should now be limited to +/- 100 in almost every case
* temporary stats changes now normalize towards 0 by 30% each week instead of by 1 point each week
* most libido changes are now temporary (largest portion from doing jobs), not permanent
* dead girls can no longer equip or use any items (no more resurrecting by giving a healing item)
* new item category "Small Weapon", covering daggers and whips and such; small weapons are considered concealable or acceptable for normal carry and are never automatically unequipped unlike regular weapons; max equipped: 1
* code for girls buying items in their free time is rewritten further to consolidate otherwise re-re-re-re-repeated code
* Starting a new "Test" (cheat) game no longer gives you Ayanami Rei; not sure why that was there, since you can Walk Around Town infinite times in cheat mode
* updated WMEdit by Solo761, to support "Small Weapon" category
* updated items file by LordShame
** new Slider control for selecting numerical values
* You now set each brothel's advertising budget on the Brothel Setup screen.
* Girls who do the advertising job now boost the effectiveness of your advertising budget by a certain percentage, based on Service skill, a few stats, and some traits, as described below.
    Foremost is the girl's Service skill. A distant second are Charisma and Intelligence. Third, Beauty and Fame. Several traits can further increase her effectiveness on par with 100% Beauty or Fame: Psychic, Cool Person, Sexy Air, Charismatic, and Charming. Some traits on the other hand reduce effectiveness: Nervous and Clumsy are minor reductions, while Retarded and Malformed are major ones.
* You can see what percentage a girl boosted your advertising effectiveness in her Turn Summary info, and you likewise get a breakdown of what brought in customers on the brothel's Turn Summary info
* new option in config.xml to disable feature which auto-equips and auto-unequips combat gear for different jobs
* fixed mission description for "have total of X girls" in Player House screen
* slave daughters now correctly have house percentage set at 100
* raised threshold for matron cheering up unhappy girls from 20 happiness to 40
* switched "House Percentage" on Girl Details screen to use new slider control
* rewrote / cleaned up portions of Slider display code and most of Scrollbar display code for lower memory usage and proper alpha transparency
* Turn Summary screen's "Go To Selected" for brothel girls resulted in broken prev/next on Girl Details screen; fixed
* Turn Summary screen's "Go To Selected" now works for dungeon girls
* When returning to Turn Summary screen from Girl Details screen, last viewed girl on Girl Details screen is now selected
* unique girls can be virgins again, based on nearly the same criteria as random girls (basically, young age and/or lack of sex skills)
* objective to get specific number of gangs can no longer go higher than the limit ( 8 )
* reduced happiness / love from giving items to girls 
* some controls (buttons, edit boxes, checkboxes) were responding to mouse scroll wheel movements as regular clicks, which they now ignore; this showed up most in the Inventory Management screen
* "auto buy" checkboxes are no longer displayed unless you have some of the item in question, to allay confusion based on it not staying checked when you have 0 of that item; setting it to auto-buy 0 of something makes no sense
* traits gained from torture in the dungeon (Broken Will, Masochist, and Mind Fucked) are no longer incorrectly set as temporary
* un-sort header on far right of listboxes could be incorrectly triggered by clicks a bit to the right of the listbox (leading to "View Details" button in dungeon sometimes additionally unsorting dungeon girl list)
* if the .gam.mast file couldn't be read (missing or otherwise) when loading a game, it will now assume you have all existing character packs (.girlsx files) loaded, instead of re-loading all of them and resulting in duplicate unique girls


1.30.0 alpha r416
* Now all extra "hidden" stats for girls are shown on More Details for debugging/reference data
* girls were getting stuck on Free Time after giving birth  (pretty serious bug, the reason I went ahead and released r416 already)

1.30.0 alpha r415
* girls should no longer automatically use consumables unless the item does something which seems useful to her at the time or makes her happy (no health potion when fully healthy, no "cure for X disease" when she doesn't have "X disease", etc.); they do still buys such items, though
* girls will now unequip all armor and weapon(s) before doing most mundane jobs like whoring, customer service, cleaning, etc.; however, girls with the following traits might refuse to do so: Aggressive, Yandere, Twisted, Retarded
* girls will likewise now equip their best (most expensive) armor and weapon(s) before doing "dangerous" jobs, such as exploring catacombs, capturing beasts, or providing security; however, Retarded girls might refuse to do so
* Items.itemsx now parses new optional GirlBuyChance % value [if not specified, chance now defaults to (100% - (badness level * 5)), so 20 or more badness is 0% chance, 5 badness is 75% chance, etc.]
	This GirlBuyChance % value is checked when a girl is on free time and shopping, and has looked at a random shop item, instead of it just checking the Badness value as it used to.
* girls shouldn't buy things like brainwashing oil and disguised slave collars for themselves any more, among other things; thanks to LordShame for updating all appropriate items
* updated WMEdit supporting new GirlBuyChance value provided by Solo761
* non-unique girls who are sold or fired are now simply removed from the game, though unique girls are still kept
* items bought from shop directly into a girls inventory were not depleting shop stock properly
* pregnant girls not controlled by player (should only be uniques, sold/fired by player) have their pregnancies handled just like girls controlled by the player; there are of course no announcements though and nothing gained by the player, and grown daughters are added to the buyable/recruitable girls
* Girl Details screen wouldn't let you go to manage a girl's inventory if it was full
* When going to Inventory Management from Girl Details screen, it would select the girl based on the name, so it could choose incorrectly if you had any girls with identical names
* animated images would get stuck on the image surface, where it couldn't then be changed to a non-animated one
* new girl packs were not being imported properly when loading a saved game, though the .gam.mast file was being updated
	as a result, for older savegames, you'll need to manually edit the .gam.mast file to delete out any files which you know aren't really loaded in order to get them to actually import at this point; new savegames should have no problem
* girls get the week off when they give birth
* injury system reworked slightly; injuries can now potentially result in unintended abortion if pregnant, which is distressing for the girl in question
* when girls buy stuff in their free time, it now indicates everything they bought in their Turn Summary info
* Gallery mode no longer shows pregnant images in the profile slot
* tweaked the bar working enjoyment

1.30.0 alpha r397
* auto-buy healing potions and nets options were not reset on "new game"
* bank withdrawals should no longer be taxed; by extension, money taken from girls or given by scripts is no longer taxed
* bad items sent directly from the shop to a girl's inventory could still cause a crash
* dead girls can no longer be enslaved or sold in the dungeon
* multi-select should now be maintained when doing actions in the dungeon
* Girl sex enjoyment messages updated a bit
* new clickable area on far right of listbox header which un-sorts the list back to the order the elements were originally added in; scrollbar and scroll up button are moved down to make room whenever it's shown
* On Girl Details screen, sort order for previous/next girl functionality now matches the girl list sort order of the screen that called it (Girl Management or Dungeon)... so, you can sort the girls based on a specific stat and then view their details in that same order
* polished the "new rival" texts a bit for spacing and fixed he/she type gender indicators
* gang training now works on a curve where they gain less the higher the skill/stat (but more at lower levels); however, they'll tend to focus training in what they're good at as well, so they should hopefully end up being better at certain skills and stats
* gang missions and combat will slightly boost appropriate gang stats/skills (not as much as training, though)
* all 6 important gang stats are now listed on the Gang Management screen; in other words, added Agility, Toughness (Constitution), and Charisma
* even if user had config set to 0% chance of any one or more types of pregnancy, virgins would still have 10% chance of getting pregnant; the (somewhat odd) 10% chance boost for virgins is left alone for any chance over 0%, though
* girl details next/prev cycle order was not properly updating IDs when a girl was removed, resulting in a crash on moving on to the last girl
* when a girl becomes pregnant or inseminated, it now makes sure to clear any leftover pregnancy data (from abortions or what-not, pregnancy countdown and unborn child data)

1.30.0 alpha r385
* switching between day and night on Girl Management screen no longer rebuilds the girl list, maintaining multi-select
* on Girl Management screen, "Fire", Sell", and "Free" buttons now work on multi-selected girls (it properly ignores slaves for "Fire", and ignores non-slaves for "Sell" and "Free")
* Selling or releasing multi-selected girls and/or customers from the Dungeon screen could cause crash
* You're now told how much gold you got when you sell girls directly from the dungeon
* girl working as matron now gets full pay (you get no house perc) and the money is deducted from you; her pay is now 200-400, depending on service skill (200+(service*2))
* jobs which do not gain money externally (from customers, exploring, whatever) now have wages deducted from you; you do still get your house percent back, though
* Updated job enjoyment changes, very slight decrease for whoring but major increase for all other jobs (+1/-1 to +3/-3)
* girls exploring the catacombs now list each gained item in turn summary
* girls doing beast care and beast capture gain a bit of bestiality skill
* girls who do the Torturer job can sometimes become Sadistic or even Merciless if they enjoy their job enough
* girls who do the Matron job can sometimes become Charismatic or even Psychic if they enjoy their job enough
* girls exploring the Catacombs or Capturing Beasts can sometimes gain the traits Adventurer, Tough, and Aggressive if they enjoy combat enough
* girls defeated in the Catacombs might end up with one of the 3 types of Scars, or even rarely One Eye or Eye Patch
* bestiality now only has a chance to harm your beasts if the girl has lower than 50 skill in bestiality; it ranges from 50% chance at 0 skill to 1% chance at 49 skill; chance was 25% regardless before
* a bug prevented girls on their free time from buying things from the shop; it's back to functional again
* girl fights can now end in draw if still going after 1000 attacks rather than potentially getting stuck in an infinite loop
* number of customers could go into the negatives due to high filthiness; added a check to set number of customers to 0 if it's in the negative
* girls now properly train in groups of up to 4 girls. The grouping of girls is now randomized, and the turn summary report indicates which girls trained with which. Also, training can no longer give negative gains ("+-1" indeed :P).
* girls who train alone (only possible if you have only 1 girl training) now have 50% chance to gain 1-3 points in a random stat, instead of 10% chance to gain 1 point; also, turn summary output for it is updated
* Matron was still a bit bugged; should work perfectly now. Also, the Matron can put herself back to work (if she took herself off duty due to getting too tired or whatever).
* number of customers lost due to filthiness is now reported in the turn summary for each brothel

1.30.0 alpha r372
* Unique girls showing up underage (< 17) should be taken care of
* WonderDog has further worked quite a bit on fixing how traits are handled, extensively fixing and improving how whore jobs work in many ways, and fixed the items file (duplicate "Sword of Forever" item and unencoded "&" character which kept Solo's item editor from working).
* Random girls would quite often default to 30 in all skills; value name lookup table was not being initialized correctly
* changed debug output from failure to load trigger file to better indicate it's not a problem ("Assuming this is a girl with no special triggers")
* the picture of the last selected girl in the girl management window would sometimes be shown when no girl was selected (or existed for that matter)
* Shift-selecting items in listboxes which support multiselect was hit-and-miss; rewrote that code so that it should respond exactly as expected
* Starting a new game was not clearing out number of beasts owned from a previously loaded game
* Items with a non-zero "How bad is it" stat crash the game 100% of the time when going directly from the store inventory to a girl's inventory. Buying to the player's inventory then transferring to a girl is still fine.
* using make-up items or any other items which provided a temporary stat boost (not skill boost) was bugged
* items which were set to impregnate or inseminate did not work correctly; now, it uses the "Amount" value as a multiplier for the chances.
    So, assuming the default config of 8% chance each for pregnancy, player pregnancy, and insemination, these item effects would have 80% chance of success (8% * 10):
    <Effect What="GirlStatus" Name="Pregnant By Player" Amount="10" />
    <Effect What="GirlStatus" Name="Pregnant" Amount="10" />
    <Effect What="GirlStatus" Name="Inseminated" Amount="10" />
    An "Amount" of 0 still removes any of the above, that hasn't been changed.
* When transferring an item on the Item Management screen, the selection is much better maintained and tracked (transferred items are selected in target inventory)
* removed availability of movie job types for now, since they were indeed entirely broken
* Whore jobs in Bar and Gambling Hall renamed to reflect location
* It was possible for more than 1 matron to be in a house by forcing a matron to rest and reassigning another girl to be matron. When the first girl was through resting she auto-magically became matron again resulting in two matrons.
* People who were consistently getting a crash immediately on running the game can now play

1.30.0 alpha r349
* Script functionality was completely borked in several ways; all scripts are now working
* When sabotaging, if rival had no gangs it could cause a crash
* work report for brothel girls kept saying she "ran out of customers who like her"; disabled that erroneous message for now
* GetRandomShopItem could return out-of-bounds (+1 over) item num, leading to crash
* Girls were losing "Incest" and "Your Daughter" trait after a while, as they were incorrectly set as temporary  --  this fix courtesy of tlib, thanks!
* There were a few further trait handling problems, and "unknown" age girls could have their age messed up  --  these fixes courtesy of WonderDog, thanks!
* Random girl name generation could go out of bounds
* customer display in dungeon was slightly off
* a specific semi-random image on the release build would fail to load for a bizarre reason; fixed by commenting out a hopefully unnecessary extra bit of animated image sanity checking
* job enjoyment text (shown in Girl Details by More button): fixed and added in support for showing enjoyment level for all current major task types, but "indifferent" ones are omitted
* when a girl captures beasts, it now indicates how many
* number of owned beasts is now shown on brothel screen
* rearranged job and job type lists on girl management screen a tad bit
* Girls with "Dependant" trait or "Mind Fucked" trait no longer have guaranteed -100 rebelliousness, it's now guaranteed -40 and -50 respectively  --  thanks to tlib for finding the root of this one
* You could not generally transfer items directly from the store to a girl.  --  the item transferring code was a bit wonky and was separate for transferring either way; I consolidated and cleane up the code, fixing it in the process
* Item lists on Item Management screen are now sorted alphabetically
* When viewing player or girl inventory item, it shows "Value: x  Sell For: y" instead of "Cost: x"
* Items listed on the item management screen now have differing font colors according to rarity. Items purchaseable in the shops are blue, the brighter the rarer. Green items are only found on the catacombs (dark green) or by scripts or objective rewards (a bit lighter green). "Common" items should be plain black, but there seems to be very little in that category currently. The rarity colors are configurable in config.xml.
* If you had negative money you could hit "deposit all" in the bank, which would reset you to 0 money
* Girls could be inseminated when using fake beasts
* Random girl traits were not properly applying skill changes... ex. pigtail girl started with lesbian trait, 0% lesbian skill  --  This fix was courtesy of WonderDog - thanks!
* Big Boobs and Abnormally Large Boobs weren't properly improving customer happiness  --  This fix also courtesy of WonderDog

1.30.0 alpha r342
* When in the dungeon with exactly one girl listed, selecting any of the column header caused the game to crash.  --  fixed
* Age variables for all the random characters were set to 0 min and max. This resulted in all random girls being 17.  --  fixed (game currently limits max age to 25, so you'll get an age range of 17-25)
* During the turn summary, clicking on the Dungeon listing will cause it to crash if there are no girls in the dungeon.  --  fixed
* "config.weeks_preg: 38" message given on debug window when viewing any girl, pregnant or not.  --  message now only shown when girl is pregnant
* Dependent trait still giving an automatic -100 rebeliousness  --  changed obedience boost from +90 to +50
* Charismatic/Charming traits still give game breaking stat boosts.  --  halved charisma boost for each
* girl images were being stretched to fit the area, losing aspect ratio (made image class default to maintaining aspect ratio)
* unique girls were incorrectly starting with 100% normal sex skill (stored in XML as "NormalSex", game was looking for "normalSex")
* some unique girls had odd starting "house percentage" values, such as 0 and 100; normalized to all starting at the default of 60
* also, Font.txt is no longer needed or checked; instead, font definition in config.xml is used for everything

v1.29

- fixed a crash when entering slave market
- group sex now involves more money
- fixed gang jobs not displaying training or recruiting as the current mission in the staff management screen
- added some new traits
- overhaul of how fetishes work. Now customers will flat out refuse a girl if she doesn't meet their fetish needs unless they are very very horny. Also girls can learn to behave differently in differently situations, so it is possible for a girl to satisfy the nerdy and cool fetishes. Also if girls become damage mentally, it limits their uses as whores (only certain customers will like them). Girls that have no fetish categories will only be hired by customers who are just after sex or by request. Next update will allow customers to have up to 3 fetishes
- fixed rival attack message where it says nothing after the ".... attacks and"

- serious injuries will now be displayed better in the summary
- modified happiness code so that it will no longer go into the negatives/positives.

- fixed girls sometimes getting pregnant with other children when they were raped by player
- added many new script commands to enable some new functionality
- mostly implemented the proposed new interaction method with girls (button still called talk for now).
	- Torturing functions like it always has
	- Scolding works best with girls whoose spirit is between 30 and 50 (still works on other levels but may also do more damage then good.
	- Forcing a girl may work for or against you (they hate you but they'll do what you say)
- Fixed problem where talk scripts for being in dungeon were not executed from the details screen (only the talk to non-dungeon girl script was running instead).
- love towards player wasn't taken into account for girls disobeying. So now players who have girls who love them will get the benefit. (objective of coding is to allow player to either rule though fear or love).
- lowered chance of girls getting perminant injury
- lowered chance of girls getting attacked on the job
- fixed item lists not updating after using items (bug only showed with consumables)
- lowered death rate in catacombs
